### The Challenge 

A national bank needed to update their online mortgage application for 2018 regulation changes. They were looking to roll out a new design that would increase online mortgage app conversions and expand additional products into online applications.  While working at WWT Asynchrony Labs, I cast a vision to reshape consumer lending for this client.

### The Approach

I started by journey mapping the home buying process, leveraging my experience as a licensed Realtor, and was able to identify opportunities to design for emotion and delight. I also did a few usability reviews of the current app to establish a baseline for success and challenge the value of existing content to users.

After testing a few ideas I ultimately landed on building a single page application that incrementally moved users along the happy path, breaking a long process into smaller chunks of activity. This approach allowed for branching logic so users could skip questiosn that weren't relevant to them and enabled a more conversational interface- answers from some questions populate the text of others.

### The Deliverables

Working with the business teams, I laid out the logic maps, wire frames, and made a prototype using InVision. There were 205 initial screens for the new home purchase flow. All my designes were synchronized from Sketch using the Craft plugin. I validated my assumptions by leading usability labs to test new interaction patterns. During the sessions I evaluated confidence level, time on task, and accuracy as my metrics.

I took my design a step further and built a responsive prototype using HTML, SaSS, and JavaScript. This gave the production app a head start, as we were under a tight deadline. I built the presentation layer of our app in Angular 4.0 and paired with other developers to fix bugs, improve accessibility, and add new Angular components and logic. Once production ramped up I made myself a proxy project manager and set up a Kanban board for story tracking. I facilitated standups and interfaced with clients daily, mitigating their feedback into digestible stories.

### The Results

Once we shipped our MVP we were awarded an additional project - a consumer portal for tracking application progress - and our design system was adopted for other digital account opening flows. As a team, we demonstrated the benefits of agile development and design thinking to a large organization, who is adopting this approach elsewhere. Mortgage Loan Originators refer customers to the online app because of its ease of use and are seeing increased conversions compared to the previous app.

*"Everyone is so excited about it as it is our first step into creating a first class experience for our customers and, I believe, will be the foundation to move us past our peers in our digital experience. Corporate marketing loved it so much that they are looking at the possibility of a commercial! All of you should take a HUGE amount of pride in the work youâ€™ve already done and the fine tuning to get this perfect. It amazes me every time I do a demo how incredible this looks. I am extremely lucky to work with this kind of talent. You all are amazing and I thank you very much for all of the effort."*
